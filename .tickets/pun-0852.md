# OTA distribution — archive, export IPA, host for install

## Notes

**2026-02-18 15:13:29 UTC:** Prereqs: paid Apple Developer account ($99/yr), Kevin's phone UDID registered in the dev portal (grab from Settings > General > About, no cable needed). Steps: (1) just archive — xcodebuild archive + exportArchive as ad-hoc IPA. (2) just distribute — push IPA + manifest plist to a served HTTPS URL on the cluster (behind gatekeeper). (3) Open itms-services:// link from Safari on phone to install. Needs ad-hoc provisioning profile with Kevin's UDID. Blocked by: pun-d7a6 (OIDC auth) for the app to actually talk to the backend.
