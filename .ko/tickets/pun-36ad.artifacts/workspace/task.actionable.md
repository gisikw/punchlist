Perfect. The plan is **complete, feasible, and actionable**:

✅ **Goal**: Clear — stop scroll oscillation on in_progress items
✅ **Context**: Accurate — lines 88-89 show the dynamic shadow radius (4 to 8) and line 220 confirms the `.defaultScrollAnchor(.bottom)`
✅ **Approach**: Well-defined — reserve fixed space with padding, animate only opacity
✅ **Tasks**: Three ordered tasks with specific line ranges and verification steps
✅ **Open Questions**: Explicitly states "None"
✅ **Files**: Both referenced files exist at the correct locations with the expected code patterns

The plan identifies the exact lines to modify (88-89 for the shadow animation, 80-82 for padding), provides a clear implementation strategy with low risk, and includes practical verification steps.
