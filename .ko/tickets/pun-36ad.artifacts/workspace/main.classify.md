Based on the ticket description, this reports **unexpected behavior** — "weird behavior where the scroll is rocking back and forth" without user interaction. The ticket asserts that something is broken (scrolling easing up and down unexpectedly), but doesn't describe what to build or suggest a clear fix.

This needs diagnosis to understand:
- Why is the scroll easing happening?
- What's causing this unwanted animation?
- Is it a physics simulation issue, an event handler problem, or something else?
