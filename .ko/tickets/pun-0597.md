# Think about unquestioned block UX (long-press to block, unblock button)

When a ticket is blocked without plan-questions (unreasoned block), the UI
needs a different affordance than the questions flow.

Ideas:
- Long-press on the card body to manually block a ticket
- Blocked-without-questions shows a simple "Unblock" button instead of questions UI
- Think about when/why a human would manually block: "don't touch this right now"
  vs "I need to think about this" vs "waiting on external dependency"
