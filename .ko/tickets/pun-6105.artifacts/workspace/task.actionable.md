Evaluating the plan:

**Completeness Check:**
- ✅ Clear goal: Add unit tests for resolved status appearance
- ✅ Identified files: PunchlistTests/PunchlistTests.swift (location specified)
- ✅ Ordered tasks: 1 task with 4 specific tests outlined
- ✅ Verification steps: "just test passes all new tests"
- ✅ Context provided: Commit reference, line numbers, existing test file structure

**Open Questions:**
- ✅ None listed (explicitly states "None")

**Feasibility:**
- ✅ References plausible existing files (PunchlistTests.swift, FilteringTests.swift already exist per context)
- ✅ Testing strategy is sound (testing computed properties that determine appearance)
- ✅ Uses existing patterns (@testable import) already in use
- ✅ References specific commits and line numbers

**Assessment:**
The plan is clear, complete, has no open questions, and the approach is well-reasoned given the constraints of SwiftUI testing without ViewInspector. It's ready for implementation.
