The ticket file contains minimal information. The frontmatter shows:
- **id**: pun-6105
- **type**: task (already classified in the frontmatter)
- **title**: "Test resolved appearance"

The ticket title "Test resolved appearance" is brief. Without additional context in the ticket body, I'll analyze what this likely means:

The title suggests testing something related to how a "resolved" state appears in the UI. This could be:
- Adding or updating tests for how a resolved item/ticket displays
- Testing visual/UI appearance when something is marked as resolved
- Verifying the resolved state shows correctly

This description aligns with a **task** - it's asking for testing work (likely code changes to add or update tests), which has a clear expected output: test code.

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
