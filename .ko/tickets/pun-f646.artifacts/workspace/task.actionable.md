The plan is complete and ready for implementation:

✓ **No open questions** — Explicitly stated as "None"
✓ **Clearly scoped** — Single, focused change (add `.buttonStyle(.plain)` to InputBar.swift)
✓ **Ordered tasks with verification** — Two clear steps with concrete verification steps
✓ **Acknowledges prior state** — Correctly identifies and addresses the out-of-scope staged changes that must be reverted
✓ **Feasible** — File paths, line numbers, and the solution approach are all concrete and plausible
