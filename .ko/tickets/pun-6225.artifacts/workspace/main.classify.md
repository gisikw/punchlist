Looking at the ticket "What does our testing story look like for this repository?" — this is asking a question that requires investigation and findings.

The ticket is asking:
- A what/how question ("what does our testing story look like?")
- For discovery and assessment of the current state
- The expected output is information/findings about the testing approach, not code changes

This is clearly a **research** ticket — it requires investigation to understand the codebase's testing practices, identify gaps, and provide findings. Any code changes (like adding tests or test infrastructure) would follow as separate tasks after this research is complete.
