Based on the ticket description, this is clearly reporting **unexpected behavior**:

- **What's broken**: Completed tasks are hidden on cold start but show up after toggling away and back
- **Expected behavior**: Completed tasks should always show in the personal view
- **Nature**: A state management or rendering bug where the UI doesn't match the data correctly on initial load

This is not a feature request (task) or an investigation question (research). It's asserting that the application has a problem that needs diagnosis and fixing.
