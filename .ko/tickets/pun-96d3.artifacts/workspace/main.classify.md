I'll review the ticket and classify it based on the instructions.

Looking at the ticket: **"Add XCTest target and test pure model decoding (Item, PlanQuestion, filtering)"**

The ticket clearly describes:
- **What to build**: An XCTest target
- **Specific code to test**: Model decoding (Item, PlanQuestion, filtering logic)
- **Expected outcome**: Code changes - new test target, test files with comprehensive tests

This is a concrete buildable task with:
- Clear requirements (add XCTest target, write specific tests)
- Defined test coverage areas (model decoding, filtering logic)
- A detailed implementation plan already provided
- Expected verification steps (xcodebuild test commands)

The ticket is **not** asking a question ("Can we do X?"), **not** reporting broken behavior ("This is broken"), and **not** requesting investigation ("What would it take?"). It's asserting what needs to be built.
