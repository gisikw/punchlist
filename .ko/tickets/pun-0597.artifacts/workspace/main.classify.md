## Analysis

The ticket describes a UI feature that needs to be designed and built. It:

1. **Identifies a problem**: The current UX doesn't have appropriate affordances for manually blocking tickets without reasoning
2. **Proposes solutions**: Long-press to block, "Unblock" button, etc.
3. **Asks for consideration**: Thinking through the UX patterns and user intent

This is asking for **code changes**—implementing new UI interactions and components to support the blocking workflow. The expected output is committed code that changes how the UI behaves.

The framing ("Think about...") suggests some design exploration may be needed upfront, but the core ask is a feature implementation task.
