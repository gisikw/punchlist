Perfect. I've reviewed the plan artifact. Here's my evaluation:

**Checklist:**

1. **Open Questions** ✅ — The plan explicitly states "None" in the Open Questions section. The single decision point (whether to scroll to the collapsed item or bottom) has already been answered and confirmed in the Notes section.

2. **Completeness** ✅ — The plan has:
   - Clear goal: Fix ScrollView container not shrinking on ticket collapse
   - Detailed context: Explains the root cause with specific line references
   - Explicit approach: Use `ScrollViewReader.scrollTo()` with timing aligned to animation
   - Three ordered tasks with specific file locations and verification steps

3. **Feasibility** ✅ — Referenced files (`ContentView.swift`, `ItemRow.swift`) and line ranges appear plausible for a SwiftUI iOS app structure. The technical approach (ScrollViewReader with delayed scrollTo after animation) is sound for SwiftUI.

The plan is complete, actionable, and ready for implementation.
