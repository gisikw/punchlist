Looking at the ticket: "Agent toggle shouldn't be visible when the project drawer is open"

This is describing **what's broken** - the agent toggle is currently visible in a situation where it shouldn't be. The ticket is asserting this is a problem (not asking whether it is), and it has a clear expected behavior: the toggle should be hidden.

This is a **bug** - unexpected/incorrect UI visibility behavior that needs to be fixed.
