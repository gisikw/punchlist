# Test resolved appearance

## Notes

**2026-02-26 15:57:18 UTC:** ko: FAIL at node 'review' — Implementation deviated from documented stopping point. The task.implement.md explicitly identified that the plan's approach (testing private computed properties) wouldn't work and stated 'I need to stop and report this discrepancy rather than silently deviate.' However, instead of stopping, the implementation proceeded with a fragile Mirror-based workaround. Additionally, tests using Mirror to access computed properties are fundamentally broken (Mirror doesn't reliably expose computed properties, only stored ones), and cannot be verified due to Xcode project corruption on the build host. The plan needs revision to either: (1) change isResolved/circleColor to internal in ItemRow.swift, (2) test at a different level, or (3) accept that this behavior cannot be unit tested.
