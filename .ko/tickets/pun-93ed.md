# If there's a large ticket expanded, on collapse the tickets can seemingly disappear because the container doesn't shrink. Scrolling eventually recovers them. But can we nudge the container to resize on item card close maybe?

## Notes

**2026-02-26 20:21:23 UTC:** Question: When a ticket collapses, should we scroll to the collapsed item or to the bottom of the list?
Answer: Scroll to collapsed item (Recommended)
Keeps the collapsed item visible and centered, allowing the container to resize properly
