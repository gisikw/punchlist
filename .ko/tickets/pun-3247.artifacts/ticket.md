# I'd like to be able to see tickets that were completed during an agent run if it was started in punchlist. Maybe when an agent is started, we save a timestamp locally, and start showing completed tickets that were completed after that timestamp. When the agent stops, the slider is replaced with the completion circle? Clicking the completion circle restores the (inactive) agent slider, and hides all closed tickets. This was we get a "what happened during that loop" review process
