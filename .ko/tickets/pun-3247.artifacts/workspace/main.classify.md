Looking at this ticket, it describes a specific feature to build:

**What's being requested:**
- Display tickets completed during an agent run
- Save a timestamp when an agent starts
- Show completed tickets with a completion timestamp
- Replace the slider with a completion circle when the agent stops
- Clicking the circle restores the inactive slider and hides closed tickets
- Provides a "what happened during that loop" review process

This is a clear **feature request** describing what to build, not investigating whether something is broken or researching feasibility. The requirements are concrete and specific.
