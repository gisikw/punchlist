I'll classify this ticket by reading it carefully.

**Ticket Analysis:**

The ticket describes a specific feature to implement:
- Save a timestamp when an agent starts
- Display tickets completed during that agent run
- Replace the slider UI with a completion circle when the agent stops
- Clicking the circle toggles visibility of session-completed tickets
- Provides a review mechanism for "what happened during that loop"

The ticket includes:
- Clear requirements (what to build)
- Design decisions documented in notes (visual treatment, timestamp persistence, multi-session behavior)
- A detailed implementation plan with 6 specific tasks
- Prior context about the codebase architecture

This is a **task** — it describes concrete code changes to implement a feature, not a problem to investigate or a question to research.
