# Let's make the hold bar action on blocked ticket behave differently: if there are no open questions, it should _open_ the ticket (assumption is it failed or we held on it, now we're ready to make it actionable again). If there _are_ open questions, then hold should still close the ticket (if we wanted to make it actionable, we could have answered the questions)
