Looking at this ticket, I need to classify it based on what it's asking for.

The ticket asks: **"How bad would it be to add very basic markdown support to body render?"**

This is phrased as a question about feasibility and impact assessment. The user is asking whether it would be reasonable to implement markdown support, not asserting that something is broken or requesting a specific implementation.

The expected output here is **findings** — an assessment of the effort, complexity, and trade-offs involved in adding markdown support to the body renderer. This is exploratory work that will inform whether and how to proceed.
