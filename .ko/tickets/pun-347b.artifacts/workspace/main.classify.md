This is a **task** ticket.

The ticket describes a specific feature to build: adding a text input that appears when tapping the status circle on project tickets, with clear requirements for behavior (call `ko triage`, dismiss on submit, only on project tickets). It specifies what to build, not what's broken or what to investigate.
