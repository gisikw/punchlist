Looking at this ticket:

**"Let's hide the agent toggle if there are no unblocked tickets"**

This is a clear **feature request** that describes what to build:
- A specific UI behavior change (hide the agent toggle)
- A clear condition (when there are no unblocked tickets)
- The expected output is code changes to implement this visibility logic

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
