# WS project switching — client sends active project tag, server rebinds broadcast to that project

## Notes

**2026-02-20 14:04:07 UTC:** Client sends {"project": "fort-nix"} over existing WS. Server removes conn from old project's broadcast set, adds to new one, and immediately pushes the new project's item list. No reconnection needed. Server-side: read loop already exists for keepalive — just parse incoming messages as project switch commands.
