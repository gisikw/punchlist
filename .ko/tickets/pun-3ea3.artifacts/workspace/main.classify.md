Looking at this ticket:

**Title**: "Some recently blocked tickets are pulsing - it's an interesting idea actually if we use it with intent, but it's accidental right now. Where's that coming from?"

**Analysis**:
- The ticket observes that recently blocked tickets are "pulsing" (showing some kind of visual behavior/animation)
- It acknowledges this could be intentional, but suspects it's happening accidentally
- The core question is: "Where's that coming from?" - asking for the source/cause of this behavior

This is clearly a **research** ticket. It's asking a diagnostic question about unexpected behavior and seeking to understand the origin of a phenomenon, not requesting a specific code change. The expected output is findings about what's causing the pulsing behavior, not a commit.
