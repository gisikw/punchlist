**Evaluation:**

✅ **Clear Goal** — Prevent empty projects drawer via retry logic and app resume refresh  
✅ **Context & Conventions** — Files identified, app patterns explained, constraints noted  
✅ **Ordered Tasks** — 4 specific tasks with verification steps and line references  
✅ **Feasibility** — References to PunchlistViewModel.swift and ContentView.swift are plausible  
✅ **No Open Questions** — Plan explicitly states none; approach is determined  
✅ **Actionable** — Tasks have clear scope, verification criteria, and backoff timing specified

The plan is well-structured and ready for implementation. The default "user" project fallback is straightforward, the retry logic is clearly specified (3 attempts, 0.5s/1s/2s delays), and the refresh() enhancement is scoped. No architectural decisions are pending.
