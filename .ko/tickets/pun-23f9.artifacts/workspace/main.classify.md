Looking at this ticket, the user is reporting unexpected behavior: "opening the projects drawer results in an empty list" that has happened "once or twice."

This is describing a problem that occurs intermittently without a clear stated cause or fix. The user is asking if there's "an easy solve" rather than describing what needs to be built. This fits the characteristics of a **bug**:

- It describes broken/unexpected behavior (empty list when it shouldn't be)
- It requires diagnosis to understand why it's happening
- The fix isn't obvious from the ticket itself
- There's an implied question: "What's causing this and how do we fix it?"
