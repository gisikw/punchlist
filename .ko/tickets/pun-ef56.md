# Can we make the in_progress ticket a little more obviously animated? The breathing dot is nice, but too subtle

## Notes

**2026-02-26 12:39:11 UTC:** Question: Should we increase the animation duration from 2.0s to 2.5s to make the breathing effect more noticeable?
Answer: Keep 2.0s duration (Recommended)
Start with just the opacity and scale changes; 2.0s is likely sufficient for visibility
