Perfect! The plan has been updated with the ticket author's clarification. The approach is now confirmed:

**Plan Summary:**
- ✅ **SSEManager disconnect debounce:** Change from 3s → 1.5s (fixes intermittent flakiness)
- ✅ **ViewModel cold-start threshold:** Keep at 3s (provides grace during startup)
- ✅ Update documentation and test comments to reflect the new 1.5s debounce
- ✅ No open questions remaining

The plan is complete and ready for implementation. All tasks are clearly defined with specific file locations, line numbers, and verification steps.
