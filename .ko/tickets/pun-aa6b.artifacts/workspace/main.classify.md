Based on the ticket content I just read:

**Ticket pun-93ed**: "If there's a large ticket expanded, on collapse the tickets can seemingly disappear because the container doesn't shrink. Scrolling eventually recovers them. But can we nudge the container to resize on item card close maybe?"

This ticket:
- Describes an observable problem (tickets disappearing when a large ticket collapses)
- Proposes a possible solution (nudge the container to resize)
- Asks for implementation ("can we...")

This is a **task** — it describes what behavior needs to be built (container resizing on card close) with a clear direction. The expected output is code changes.
