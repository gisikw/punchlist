Looking at this ticket:

**"Can the add item input grow dynamically with word-wrap? If this is liable to cause cascading UX issues, push back on this"**

This is explicitly asking a question ("Can...?") and requesting investigation with a conditional recommendation ("If this is liable to cause cascading UX issues, push back"). The ticket is not describing what to build or what's broken — it's asking whether something is feasible and what the consequences might be.

The expected output is findings and a decision (proceed with the feature, or push back), not committed code.
