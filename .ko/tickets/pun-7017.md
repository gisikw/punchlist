# Project indicator — show current project name/slug at top, dots or similar for position

## Notes

**2026-02-20 14:05:07 UTC:** UI treatment: mirror the 'punchlist' app label (top left) with the active project tag in the top right, e.g. '#fort-nix'. Same modest styling. No dots/pagination — just the tag. Personal/user project could show '#user' or nothing (since it's the default, maybe absence of a tag IS the indicator).

**2026-02-20 14:06:01 UTC:** Personal/default project shows no tag (blank top-right). Only non-default projects show the #tag.
