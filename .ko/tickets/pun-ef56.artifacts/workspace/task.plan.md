The plan has been updated to reflect that the open question about animation duration has been resolved. The user chose to keep the 2.0s duration and proceed with just the opacity and scale changes.

**Plan Summary:**
- **Shadow opacity**: 0.06-0.18 → 0.03-0.28 (stronger contrast)
- **Circle fill opacity**: 0.1-0.25 → 0.15-0.4 (more dramatic breathing dot)
- **Add scale effect**: 1.0 to 1.08 on the circle to create gentle growing/shrinking
- **Duration**: Keep at 2.0s (user confirmed)

The plan respects the pun-36ad constraint (no shadow radius changes) and provides concrete verification steps for each task. Ready for implementation.
