Looking at this ticket, I can classify it directly without investigating the codebase.

## Analysis

The ticket states:
- **What**: "Can we make the in_progress ticket a little more obviously animated?"
- **Current state**: "The breathing dot is nice, but too subtle" (acknowledged as working)
- **Direction**: Make the existing animation more visible/prominent

This is describing **what to build** (a more visible animation) rather than what's broken. The breathing effect already works; it just needs to be more noticeable. This is a straightforward enhancement request with clear direction.
