Looking at this ticket, I can classify it directly without needing to investigate the codebase.

The ticket states:
- **What**: "Can we make the in_progress ticket a little more obviously animated?"
- **Why**: "The breathing dot is nice, but too subtle"
- **Expected outcome**: Modify the animation to be more visible/obvious

This is describing **what to build** (a more visible animation) rather than what's broken. The current behavior (subtle breathing dot) is acknowledged as working, just not prominent enough. This is a straightforward feature/enhancement request with a clear direction.
