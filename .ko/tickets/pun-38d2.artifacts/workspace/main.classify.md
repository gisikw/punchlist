Looking at this ticket, I need to classify the type of work it requires.

**Ticket Analysis:**
- The ticket describes a specific visual enhancement: applying a breathing animation to the entire in_progress card (with a pulsing blue shadow/glow) rather than just the circle indicator
- It clearly specifies what should be built ("the card itself has a pulsing blue shadow/glow")
- This is a feature request, not reporting a bug or asking for investigation
- The expected output is code changes to implement the animation

This is clearly describing **what to build**, not what's broken or what needs investigation.
