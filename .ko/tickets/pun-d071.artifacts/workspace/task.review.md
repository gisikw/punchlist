## Verification Complete

The implementation is correct and ready to proceed. All planned tasks were completed successfully, with one intentional deviation (skipping Task 4) that was properly documented and justified.

**Key findings:**
- ✅ All three required tasks implemented correctly
- ✅ Visual treatment matches ticket requirements: green circle for completion, normal text for visibility
- ✅ No invariant violations
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Scope is appropriate and focused
- ✅ Implementation creates the intended distinction between "closed" (faded) and "resolved" (complete but prominent)
