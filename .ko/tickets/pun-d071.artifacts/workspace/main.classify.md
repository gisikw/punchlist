Looking at this ticket, I need to classify what kind of work it describes.

**Ticket Analysis:**

The ticket describes a requested feature:
- **What it states**: "Could we show these tickets with a green treatment in project view"
- **What needs to be done**: Visual/styling changes to display "resolved" status tickets differently in the UI (using green treatment similar to completed items)
- **Expected output**: Code changes to implement this UI treatment

**Classification:**

This is a **task**. The ticket clearly describes what to build:
- A specific visual treatment for "resolved" status tickets
- Implementation should use existing styling patterns (the completed circle treatment)
- It's a feature request with a clear scope (project view display)

The ticket doesn't describe broken behavior or ask for investigation—it requests a concrete feature implementation.
