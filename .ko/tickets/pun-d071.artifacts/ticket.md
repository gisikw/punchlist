# There's a ticked status called "resolved", which is different from closed. This is "the work is done, and a human should see it". Often the case with question tickets or things that are a bit wontfix. Similar to how we have the red treatment for questions, could we show these tickets with a green treatment in project view (could use the same completed circle treatment, tbh)
