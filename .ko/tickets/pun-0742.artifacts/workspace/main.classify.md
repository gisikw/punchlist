Based on the ticket content, I can see:

**Title**: "Add polling fallback when SSE is disconnected"

**Analysis**:
- The ticket describes a **feature to build** - implementing a polling fallback mechanism when Server-Sent Events (SSE) disconnect
- It specifies exactly what needs to be implemented (a fallback behavior)
- The expected output is code changes
- This is a clear implementation task, not a diagnosis or investigation
