loop: building pun-43d8 — The top checkbox for when an agent is done, that needs to go away on tap. Right now, tapping it dims it but doesn't do anything. Aside from clearing the indicator, it doesn't need to close any tickets or anything for now.

loop: building pun-3329 — Pulse animation should apply to in_progress tickets AND tickets with open plan questions. Fix transient pulsing on tickets that appear in_progress briefly but shouldn't be. Followup to pun-3ea3.

loop: building pun-07b1 — Let's make the hold bar action on blocked ticket behave differently: if there are no open questions, it should _open_ the ticket (assumption is it failed or we held on it, now we're ready to make it actionable again). If there _are_ open questions, then hold should still close the ticket (if we wanted to make it actionable, we could have answered the questions)

loop: building pun-8b48 — Let's add basic markdown parsing to ticket bodies. I like keeping the font small and readable the way that it is - so just treating headers as bold or something similarly simple could work? Doesn't need to be exhaustive, but would be nice to see some basic ticket note body parsing

loop: building pun-347b — Add triage text input: tapping the status circle on a project ticket opens a text entry. On submit, call ko triage <id> <text> via KoAPI. Dismiss the input on submit. Only available on project tickets (not personal view).
loop: pun-347b SUCCEED
loop: building pun-c83a — Triage visual treatment: if a ticket has a triage value, render the status circle as filled grey. Tickets with triage should not be eligible for additional triage (don't open the text input on tap).
