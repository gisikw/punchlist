loop: building pun-43d8 — The top checkbox for when an agent is done, that needs to go away on tap. Right now, tapping it dims it but doesn't do anything. Aside from clearing the indicator, it doesn't need to close any tickets or anything for now.

loop: building pun-3329 — Pulse animation should apply to in_progress tickets AND tickets with open plan questions. Fix transient pulsing on tickets that appear in_progress briefly but shouldn't be. Followup to pun-3ea3.
